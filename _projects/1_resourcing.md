    Entrepreneurial ecosystems provide resources relevant to the entrepreneurship process, and entrepreneurs leverage and expand their networks to mobilize such resources. Thus, I jointly analyze networks, networking, and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

    abstract:
        Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (EEs) are expected to support high growth entrepreneurship. Yet, little is known about how they actually promote entrepreneurial activities. Based on Giddens’ structuration theory, this paper takes the entrepreneurs’ perspective to understand how they actually use the resources provided by an EE. Based on semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs and other relevant actors in the Berlin EE along with participant observation at entrepreneurship events, this case study focuses on the resourcing practices of different types of entrepreneurs. It shows that the Berlin EE comprises two distinct subsystems. On the basis of this evidence it is proposed that EEs can have different degrees of integration and that this characteristic strongly impacts how entrepreneurs can actually acquire resources from the EE and thus how specific EEs promote different types of entrepreneurs. Heterogeneous structures therefore do not only exist between EEs but also within EEs. This heterogeneity needs to be recognized in order to understand how EEs function, enhance the comparability of research results, and design suitable political instruments to promote entrepreneurship effectively.

        Silicon Valley is widely recognised as a leading entrepreneurial ecosystem as it provides a plethora of key resources that promote entrepreneurship. Although the existing ecosystem debate implicitly assumes that entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, we argue that this is not necessarily the case. We explore how entrepreneurs access ecosystem resources, specifically risk capital, and compare Silicon Valley with Berlin. We find that each ecosystem has a different ecosystem entry threshold at which start-ups become investable and can access financial resources. Entrepreneurs share an understanding of investors’ criteria: in Silicon Valley, start-ups must demonstrate venture traction, meanwhile in Berlin a strong founding team is sufficient. Consequently, they undertake legitimizing activities to fulfil these anticipated investment criteria accordingly prior to fundraising. Therefore, our study demonstrates how Silicon Valley is a highly selective and demanding ecosystem, and argues that it excludes many entrepreneurs, fosters inequality, and leads to homogeneity among start-ups.

        In my PhD monograph, I compared interorganizational tie formation of innovative start-ups and university spin-offs in Silicon Valley and Berlin. To address the important research gap on interorganizational tie formation under conditions of high uncertainty and power asymmetry, I conducted 85 interviews with entrepreneurs and other relevant entrepreneurial actors and observed 26 entrepreneurship events in Silicon Valley and Berlin. Especially during the early founding stages, new ventures rely heavily on varying resources from their environment, but at the same time, they face great challenges to acquire them. Taking a structurationist perspective, I argued that entrepreneurial ecosystems do not only provide resources, but also scripts about how to acquire these resources. By comparing tie formation scripts and practices in Silicon Valley and Berlin, I showed how these entrepreneurial ecosystems impact interorganizational tie formation.

      Entrepeneurial actions represent a surprising void in the recent economic-sociological discourse on inequality. Yet entrepreneurial actions not only contribute to the creation of inequalities, but can also address and deal with them. In this chapter, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between entrepreneurship and inequality needs to consider multiple perspectives on this relationship and their interplay. To this end, we propose four perspectives: Firstly, entrepreneurial activity takes place under unequal conditions. Second, inequalities are found within the population of entrepreneurs. Third, entrepreneurship can be understood as a mechanism that produces inequalities. Fourthly, inequalities can also be identified, addressed and dealt with in the course of entrepreneurial activity. We then illustrate these four perspectives on entrepreneurship and inequality using the example of the Berlin start-up ecosystem. It becomes clear how these multiple perspectives make it possible to grasp the connection between entrepreneurial activity and social inequality in its multidimensionality.

        Although the entrepreneurial team has gained increasing attention as a unit of analysis, we still do not understand much about how these teams form. Previous research has focused either on existing social relationships and their role in the search for potential team members or on criteria for selecting team members. Consequently, we do not yet understand the interplay of search and selection. Another long-neglected aspect that is being increasingly recognized in entrepreneurship research is that the entrepreneurial process is influenced by its social context beyond existing social relationships. This social context is another important factor that has to be considered to properly understand team formation. To analyze how specific characteristics of one particularly relevant social context—namely, the entrepreneurial field—impact the search for and selection of team members, I conducted a qualitative, multiple-case study that compares innovative new ventures in Berlin. The study shows that different types of ventures in different phases exhibit different team formation patterns based on their different and changing social contexts. From these pattern, I have derived different team-formation mechanisms and propositions about the conditions under which they apply.

I’m fascinated by how innovative entrepreneurs acquire resources during the very early days of their new ventures. Entrepreneurs leverage and expand their networks to mobilize resources, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem provides (at least some of) these resources. This research area comprises three broad topics.
First, I analyze *entrepreneurial ecosystems* to develop a profound understanding about their different forms and functioning across regions. For example, this research focusses on how the fragmentation of the Berlin EE shapes resource accessibility for entrepreneurs, and how inequalities are (re-)produced within the Berlin EE. Furthermore, it emphasizes the high entrepreneurial entrance barriers of Silicon Valley.

* The fragmentation of the Berlin EE. Listen to [my ERD podcast](http://entrepreneurship-erd.com/podcast/authors-e1-katharina-scheidgen-degrees-of-integration-how-a-fragmented-entrepreneurial-ecosystem-promotes-different-types-of-entrepreneurs/){:target="new"}.
* Inequality within the Berlin EE *(with Isabell Stamm and others)*
* High entrance barriers of the Silicon Valley EE. Watch our [conference presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iafvoaMaYz8&ab_channel=SchoolofGeographyandPlanningCardiffUniversity){:target="new"}. *(with Michaela Hruskova)*

Second, I compare *entrepreneurial tie formation* in Silicon Valley and Berlin, arguing that the EEs shape how ties can and should be formed. For example, different ties can be leveraged in Silicon Valley and Berlin to approach investors. Silicon Valley-based entrepreneurs can approach first customers in the same way as they approach investors, while Berlin-based entrepreneurs have to engage in different practices. Who you can ask for advice does even differ among Berlin-based entrepreneurs, i.e. start-up and spin-off entrepreneurs.

* Comparing investor tie formation Silicon Valley and Berlin *(with Anna Brattström)*
* Particularities of advice tie formation in Berlin *(with Philip Roth)*

Third, I argue that focusing on a single entrepreneur and how she networks is insufficient, since entrepreneurship is predominantly a team effort. Thus, *entrepreneurs network as a team*. In line with this argument, I also showed how templates for how a good team should look like shape entrepreneurial teams formation.
