    My research takes a dual perspective on digitalization in times of crises. On the one hand, entrepreneurial opportunities for digital social innovation arise during the Covid-19 pandemic. On the other hand, entrepreneurs cope with crisis through digitalization.

    abstract: |
      As physical distancing is a core measure of containing the spread of COVID-19, this pandemic is a crisis that has uprooted social interaction. While current research mainly focuses on crises as a challenge for entrepreneurial ventures and potential regulatory response mechanisms, we complement this research by addressing the question of how crises in general—and COVID-19’s physical distancing measures in particular—shape entrepreneurial opportunities for social innovation. Based on two rounds of data collection—desktop research mapping out 95 entrepreneurial activities in Germany and four focus groups—we find first that entrepreneurs are proactive agents in alleviating the negative consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. They do so by creating two types of digital social innovation: digital brokering and digitized services. Second, we note that negative societal consequences of crises can be buffered by shifts in entrepreneurs’ strategic orientation through improvised venturing, rapid pivoting and pro-social product extension. Third, we note variance in the persistence of changes with consequences for entrepreneurial opportunities and social innovation: Whereas some social innovation are rather ephemeral, others might endure and promise long-term impacts. We offer key insights for the literature on crisis, social innovation and hybrid organizing as well as on the implications for entrepreneurship practice and policy.

Crises hit entrepreneurs hard since they have little buffer to cope with such turbulences. At the same time, entrepreneurs strive in turbulent times. Based on the current Covid-19 pandemic, my research takes a double perspective on crises, entrepreneurship and digitalization.

First, since physical distancing is a core measure to mitigate the spread of the virus, entrepreneurial opportunities for digital social innovation arose. The pandemic came as an exogenous shock and fostered entrepreneurial activities not only among pre-existing entrepreneurial ventures, but also among people who were previously not engaged with entrepreneurship or social innovation. These entrepreneurial activities aimed to mitigate the societal consequences of crises, emphasizing the important role of entrepreneurial activities for society.

Second, this exogeneous shock imposed severe constraints on society at large, economic actors, and entrepreneurs in particular. Solo-entrepreneurs have particularly little buffer and lack organizational capacities to react to such turbulences.
