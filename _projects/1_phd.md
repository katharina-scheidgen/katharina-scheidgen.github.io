In my PhD monograph, I compared interorganizational tie formation of innovative start-ups and university spin-offs in Silicon Valley and Berlin. To address the important research gap on in-terorganizational tie formation under conditions of high uncertainty and power asymmetry, I conducted 85 interviews with entrepreneurs and other relevant entrepreneurial actors and ob-served 26 entrepreneurship events in Silicon Valley and Berlin. Especially during the early founding stages, new ventures rely heavily on varying resources from their environment, but at the same time, they face great challenges to acquire them. Taking a structurationist perspective, I argued that entrepreneurial ecosystems do not only provide resources, but also scripts about how to acquire these resources. By comparing tie formation scripts and practices in Silicon Valley and Berlin, I showed how these entrepreneurial ecosystems impact interorganizational tie formation.
