  summary: |
      My research takes a sociological perspective on entrepreneurship and innovation. It is located at the intersection of entrepreneurship,
      organizational theory, and sociology. My past work primarily addressed the tie formation of innovative new ventures and the discourse
      on entrepreneurial ecosystems. My current research builds a bridge between research on entrepreneurial teams and networks in entrepreneurship.
